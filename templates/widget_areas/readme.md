#Dev Notes:

"standard.php" will be used for any standard widget area if there is no other template named after its id (eg: "footer" sidebar will use footer.php)

"multi-widget-area.php" will be used for widget area with "type" == "multiple". See inc/hooks/widget_areas.php

Child theme can overwrite these templates.
