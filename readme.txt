Alien Ship WordPress Theme
--------------------------

Alien Ship is a responsive starter theme for WordPress. It uses Twitter's Bootstrap version 3.x. It comes with core HTML, CSS, and Javascript for type, form, grids, navigation, buttons, dropdown menus, and more. Visit http://www.johnparris.com/alienship/ to see the theme in action, to download it, or to read the documentation.



Contributions
-------------
I mostly build this theme for my use, but I am open to contributions. All contributions should be done in a feature/fix branch off the dev branch so that it can be merged back into the dev branch.

If you have more than just a small fix or enhancement, please discuss the idea with me first in the issues. Thanks.

Thanks to the original authors of Twitter's Bootstrap and Automattic's _s theme, and everyone else who has contributed to both and to the included libraries and assets.




Twitter Bootstrap
-----------------

Bootstrap is Twitter's toolkit for kickstarting CSS for websites, apps, and more. It includes base CSS styles for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, alerts, and more.

To get familiar with the features -- checkout http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap!




Automattic _s

I used the _s theme from Automattic as a base starter theme.
